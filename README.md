# IcyTower
## Introduction
Hello there!

This is a project created for my OOP course. If I will have time and willingness, I'll improve it and add new features, to make it better looking and more fun to play.

You are welcome to create Issues and forks.

## Run the game
In order to play the game you need to have installed `node.js` and `npm`

If you have those then install http-server, with:
```
npm i --global http-server
```
And after navigating to directory with a game, run:
```
http-server
```

Now you should see in your terminal available links, on which the game is running.

## Controls
You can move left/right with left/right arrows 
and in order to jump, you need to press space.

## Rules of the game
Rules are simple.

1. Game starts when you land on a platform
2. Platforms are constantly falling
3. If you fall to the ground, game is finished
4. Height of your jump is depended on your movement speed
5. If you jump on the side and immediately jump again, you'll get an extra velocity bonus
6. Further to the game, speed of platforms is increased and platforms them self change
7. Score is counted based on how high you've climbed the tower

## Enjoy!
